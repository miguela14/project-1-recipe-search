## Project Summary:
As a user of this website I would like to be able to search for recipes, compile recipes, and have a place to save them.
I would also like to be able to get recommendations based off of my location and the weather in the area.
Implement the functionality to search for recipes based on user input. Currently, the code is fetching recipe data based on a hardcoded search query. we can update the fetchRecipeData function to take user input as a parameter and fetch recipe data based on the user's search query.
Add error handling for when the API calls fail. Right now, the code assumes that the API calls will always be successful, but in reality, they can fail for various reasons. we can add error handling code to gracefully handle API call failures and display a user-friendly error message.
Implement functionality to save recipes. Add a button or a link on each recipe card that allows users to save the recipe to their "saved recipes" list. We can use browser's local storage to store the saved recipes.
Implement functionality to display saved recipes. Once users save recipes, we can add a "saved recipes" page that displays the list of saved recipes. We can use browser's local storage to retrieve the saved recipes and render them on the "saved recipes" page.
